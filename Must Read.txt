1)This code contains multiples steps of : Data importing, Data exploration, Data cleaning, Data Pre-procressing, 
Duplicates removal Algorithms, Sentiment Analysis basis on POS tags and TextBlob.

2)Each Duplicate removal Algorithm is separate from the other, either an updated version of the previous or a total different version.

3)Each Algorithm can only be run alone with the whole code based on the condition you want 
without running the other algorithms to avoid unnecessary rows removal and dataframe mixing!!

4)The Data cleaning function of removing URLs, punctuations, etc, can be run either before the duplicate 
algorithm to clean the texts and maximize the duplicate algorithm speed and be used on the Sentiment 
Analysis OR can be run after the duplicate algorithm to only be used on Sentiment Analysis.
